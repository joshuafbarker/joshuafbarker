### Hello, I am Joshua Barker ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate front-end engineer with over a decade of experience. I take pride in developing simple and readable code that still get's the complex jobs done. I've worked with teams of all sizes to produce scalable and maintainable web applications across a wide variety of technologies.

**Here are some languages and frameworks I have come to love over the years:**

- TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte
- CSS, SASS, Tailwind
- HTML
